Getting started with Chisel Operator is easy! We currently support the current (plus the last two versions) of Kubernetes. Kustomize is only supported at the moment, but a Helm chart is in progress.

## Kustomize

```bash
kubectl apply -k https://github.com/FyraLabs/chisel-operator
```

Yup, that's it.
